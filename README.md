Based on SAM2, after fine-tuning for the left atrium, the rough segmentation of the left atrium can be completed. Based on the rough segmentation results, through multi-step algorithm processing, the fine segmentation results of the left atrium, left atrial appendage, and left (right) superior (inferior) pulmonary veins can be sequentially obtained.
Further, the calculations for the volume of the left atrium, anteroposterior diameter of the left atrium, superior-inferior diameter of the left atrium, left-right diameter of the left atrium, volume of the left atrial appendage, angle of the left pulmonary vein opening, and angle of the right pulmonary veins were sequentially completed.
We will open-source our code later and provide examples for demonstration of the results.
